|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Applying a reasoning process to itself or using self-referential logic. |
| **Relation** | Related to meta-reasoning and formal logic. |
| **Example** | Understanding the concept of "the set of all sets" or writing recursive algorithms. |

### 8. Parallel Reasoning

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Simultaneously considering multiple lines of reasoning or possibilities. |
| **Relation** | Related to divergent and integrative reasoning. |
| **Example** | A chess player simultaneously analyzing multiple potential move sequences. |

### 9. Distributed Reasoning

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Reasoning spread across multiple agents, systems, or components. |
| **Relation** | Involves social and systems reasoning. |
| **Example** | A team collaboratively solving a problem with each member contributing different expertise. |

### 10. Embodied Reasoning

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Reasoning grounded in physical experience and sensorimotor interaction with the environment. |
| **Relation** | Involves spatial, practical, and situated reasoning. |
| **Example** | Understanding "up" and "down" through physical experience with gravity. |

## Summary

This comprehensive taxonomy includes **100 types of reasoning** organized into thematic categories. While the three fundamental forms (deductive, inductive, and abductive) serve as the foundation, most reasoning in practice involves combinations and specializations of these basic forms, adapted to specific domains, contexts, and purposes. The boundaries between types are often fluid, and many real-world reasoning tasks employ multiple types simultaneously.
