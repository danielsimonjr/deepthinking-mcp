=== SUMMARY ===

This comprehensive taxonomy includes 100 types of reasoning organized into thematic categories. While the three fundamental forms (deductive, inductive, and abductive) serve as the foundation, most reasoning in practice involves combinations and specializations of these basic forms, adapted to specific domains, contexts, and purposes. The boundaries between types are often fluid, and many real-world reasoning tasks employ multiple types simultaneously.
