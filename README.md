## Features

### 13 Specialized Reasoning Modes

#### Core Modes
- **Sequential**: Iterative refinement with revision capabilities and branching

- **Mathematics**: Theorem proving, lemma derivation, symbolic computation
- **Physics**: Tensor formulation, dimensional analysis, conservation laws
- **Hybrid**: Intelligently combines modes based on problem characteristics

#### Advanced Reasoning Modes (v2.0)
- **Abductive**: Generate and evaluate hypotheses to explain observations. Perfect for debugging, root cause analysis, and diagnostic reasoning.
- **Causal**: Build causal graphs with nodes and edges, analyze interventions and their effects. Ideal for impact analysis and system design.
- **Bayesian**: Update beliefs using probabilistic reasoning with priors, likelihoods, and evidence. Essential for risk assessment and A/B testing.
- **Counterfactual**: Explore alternative scenarios and compare outcomes. Excellent for post-mortems and strategic planning.
- **Analogical**: Transfer knowledge across domains by identifying structural similarities. Great for design patterns and innovative problem-solving.
n#### Phase 3 Reasoning Modes (v2.3+)
- **Temporal**: Model events, intervals, and temporal relationships using Allen's interval algebra. Track causality over time with timestamps, durations, and temporal constraints. Perfect for timeline analysis, scheduling problems, and understanding event sequences.
- **Game Theory**: Analyze strategic interactions between rational agents. Define games, players, and strategies. Compute Nash equilibria (pure and mixed), identify dominant strategies, construct payoff matrices, and build extensive-form game trees. Ideal for competitive analysis, mechanism design, and strategic decision-making.
- **Evidential**: Apply Dempster-Shafer theory for reasoning with uncertain and incomplete evidence. Define hypotheses, collect evidence with reliability scores, assign belief functions with mass assignments, combine evidence using Dempster's rule, compute belief and plausibility intervals, and make decisions under uncertainty. Ideal for sensor fusion, diagnostic reasoning, intelligence analysis, and situations with incomplete information.
- **First-Principles**: Derive conclusions from foundational axioms and principles using deductive reasoning. Define principles (axioms, definitions, observations), build derivation chains with logical inferences, track confidence levels, and reach conclusions with certainty analysis.

- Required status checks before merging
- PR review requirements
- Linear history enforcement
- Force push protection

#### Integration Tests

**MCP Protocol Compliance** (43 tests):
- Tool schema validation for all 13 modes
- Required/optional field validation
- MCP response format compliance
- Error handling for invalid inputs

**Multi-Session Scenarios** (18 tests):
- Session isolation and concurrent operations
- Resource management (50+ sessions)
- State consistency verification
- Concurrent error handling

**Error Handling & Edge Cases** (36 tests):
- Invalid session operations
- Boundary conditions (0, 1, MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)
- Large data handling (100 thoughts, 50 dependencies)
- Unicode and special character support
- Mode-specific edge cases

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Please ensure:

1. **Tests pass**: Run `npm test` - maintain or improve the pass rate (currently 93%)
2. **Type checking passes**: Run `npm run typecheck` - must have 0 TypeScript errors ✅
3. **Code formatting**: Run `npm run format:check` or `npm run format`
4. **Linting passes**: Run `npm run lint`
5. **CI/CD workflows pass**: All GitHub Actions checks must pass
6. **Test coverage**: Maintain or improve test coverage
7. **Documentation**: Update README.md and CHANGELOG.md for new features

See `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` for branch protection requirements and `.github/workflows/` for CI/CD pipeline details.
