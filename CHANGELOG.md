## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-14

### Added

#### New Reasoning Modes
- **Abductive Reasoning Mode**: Inference to the best explanation with hypothesis generation and evaluation
  - Observation tracking with confidence levels
  - Hypothesis generation with assumptions and predictions
  - Evaluation criteria: parsimony, explanatory power, plausibility, testability
  - Evidence tracking (supporting/contradicting)
  - Best explanation selection

- **Causal Reasoning Mode**: Cause-effect analysis with causal graphs
  - Causal graph structure with nodes (causes, effects, mediators, confounders) and edges
  - Edge properties: strength (-1 to 1), confidence (0-1)
  - Intervention analysis with expected effects
  - Causal mechanisms (direct, indirect, feedback)
  - Cycle detection for graph validation

- **Bayesian Reasoning Mode**: Probabilistic reasoning with evidence updates
  - Prior probability with justification
  - Likelihood calculations P(E|H) and P(E|¬H)
  - Posterior probability computation
  - Bayes factor for evidence strength
  - Sensitivity analysis support

- **Counterfactual Reasoning Mode**: What-if scenario analysis
  - Actual scenario tracking
  - Multiple counterfactual scenarios
  - Intervention point specification
  - Comparison analysis (differences, insights, lessons)
  - Causal chain tracking

- **Analogical Reasoning Mode**: Cross-domain pattern matching
  - Source and target domain modeling
  - Entity and relation mapping
  - Structural similarity assessment
  - Insight transfer
  - Analogical inference generation
  - Limitation identification
  - Analogy strength scoring

#### Validation Engine Enhancements
- `validateAbductive()`: Validates observations, hypotheses, evaluation criteria, and best explanation
- `validateCausal()`: Validates causal graphs, detects cycles, checks interventions
- `validateBayesian()`: Validates probability ranges, Bayes factor, evidence likelihoods
- `validateCounterfactual()`: Validates scenarios, intervention points, comparisons
- `validateAnalogical()`: Validates domain mappings, entity references, analogy strength
- Causal graph cycle detection algorithm with feedback loop support

#### Testing
- `tests/unit/abductive.test.ts`: 10 comprehensive tests for abductive reasoning
- `tests/unit/causal.test.ts`: 10 tests including cycle detection and intervention validation
- `tests/unit/bayesian.test.ts`: 10 tests for probability calculations and Bayes factors
- `tests/unit/counterfactual.test.ts`: 8 tests for scenario analysis
- `tests/unit/analogical.test.ts`: 9 tests for domain mapping and analogies
- Updated `tests/unit/types.test.ts` with 5 new type guard tests
- **Total test count increased from 61 to 77 tests**

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive README updates with all 10 modes documented
- 8 detailed examples (one for each reasoning mode)
- Parameter documentation for all new modes
- `docs/REASONING_MODES_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: Complete architectural design
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md`: Detailed task breakdown with code snippets

#### Type System
- 50+ new TypeScript interfaces for advanced reasoning modes
- Type guards: `isAbductiveThought`, `isCausalThought`, `isBayesianThought`, `isCounterfactualThought`, `isAnalogicalThought`
- Extended `ThinkingMode` enum from 6 to 11 values
- Enhanced tool schema with all new mode parameters

### Changed
- Updated package description to reflect 10 reasoning modes
- Enhanced tool schema description with comprehensive mode documentation
- Updated README roadmap to show Phase 2 completion
- Expanded npm keywords for better discoverability

### Deprecated
- None

### Removed
- None

### Fixed
